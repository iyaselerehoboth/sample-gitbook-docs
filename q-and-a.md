# Q&A

## Can I become who I want to be?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## How do start a car ?

You start a car by carrying out some major steps. These steps are outlined below:

1. Get the car and open the car door.
2. Reach down to the latch and open the car hood
3. Check the basic engine essentials. \(ie. fuel, engine oil, tire pressure etc.\)
4. Close the hood get into the car
5. Ensure the gear is in neutral \(or park for automatic engines\)
6. Then start your engine ðŸ˜€ 

## Is there a code to start the car ?

You can start the car using the code below.

num_sqrt = cmath.sqrt(num)
print('The square root of {0} is {1:0.3f}+{2:0.3f}j'.format(num ,num_sqrt.real,num_sqrt.imag))
